## Hi there 👋
I’m Bhoomi Kaushik, a Full Stack-focused Developer building modern and responsive web experiences.
I turn ideas into clean, interactive, and user-friendly websites.
If I imagine it — I try to design it, code it, and ship it. 🚀

**🎯 Goal**
* To become a powerful full stack developer and build digital experiences that feel smooth, fast, and meaningful.

## 💡 What Makes Me Different

✔ I focus on both design & development
✔ I write clean, structured, and readable code
✔ I care about user experience, not just functionality
✔ I believe small details create big impact

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I’m open to:

* Freelance projects
* Internship opportunities
* Remote collaborations
* Real-world product building

Let’s turn your idea into something powerful 🚀

 **⚡ Fun Facts**

* I love designing before coding.
* Dark theme > light theme.
* Always learning something new.
* Consistency over motivation.

> **✨ Every powerful product starts as a small idea.  
> I help turn that idea into reality.**
